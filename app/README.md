# Streamlit application

I wrote a streamlit application which shows some interactive plots and allows the user to
fill a survey on flight ratings.

- Project overview
- Exploration
- Interactive survey for rating a flight
- Predicting if customer is satisfied or not
- Displaying survey data

## Run application
`streamlit run Welcome.py`
